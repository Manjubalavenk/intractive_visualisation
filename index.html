            <h1>US Minimum Wage</h1>
            <p>
                In the United States, states and the federal government set minimum hourly pay ("minimum wage") that workers can receive to ensure that citizens experience a minimum quality of life.

                This is a cleaned dataset of US state and federal minimum wages from 1968 to 2020 (including 2020 equivalency values). The data was scraped from the United States Department of Labor's table of minimum wage by state(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/history).
